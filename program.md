UrbanRec 2024 will be a half-day, in-person workshop with various activities, including a keynote, paper sessions, and plenary discussions.

### Keynote: Annelien Smets 

Annelien Smets is Research Professor and Senior Researcher at imec-SMIT, Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Her research focuses on serendipity and recommender systems, both in media markets and urban environments. Currently, she is PI of the research project [Serendipity Engine](https://www.serendipityengine.be/) (Research Foundation Flanders), which aims to support societal stakeholders in designing recommender systems that foster serendipity in public contexts. Additionally, she serves as track lead in the [VUB Strategic Research Program](https://www.srpmedia.be/) on media economics and recommender systems. Her recent work explores how urban recommender systems can enhance public space experiences by promoting serendipitous encounters, contributing to both individual well-being and societal cohesion. Since 2021, she serves as co-chair of the Serendipity Academic Researchers Network. In 2023, Annelien received the ACM Women in RecSys Journal Paper of the Year Award for her work on multi-stakeholder recommender systems.
