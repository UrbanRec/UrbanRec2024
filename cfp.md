# Call for Papers - UrbanRec Workshop 2024

Recommender systems are already widely used to help people choose accommodations, attractions, restaurants, and navigate cities. As the population continues to centralize in urban areas and cities grow, navigating and fully utilizing their potential becomes increasingly challenging. Thus, recommendation technology is playing a more significant role in shaping how people perceive and make decisions in cities. This workshop aims to bring together industry professionals and academics to enhance recommendation systems in urban environments, with a focus on individual needs, urban health, and well-being.

We welcome paper submissions focusing on recommender systems for urban environments.  The following topics provide an non-exhaustive overview of possible themes.
